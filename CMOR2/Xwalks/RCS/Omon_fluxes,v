                                      This is the net flux of heat entering the liquid water column through its 
                                      upper surface (excluding any 'flux adjustment').

     QSW_HTP                          This is the flux into the surface of liquid sea water only. This excludes 
                                      shortwave flux absorbed by sea ice, but includes any light that passes
                                      through the ice and is absorbed by the ocean.

                                      This is defined as "where ice_free_sea over sea"; i.e., the total flux 
                                      (considered here) entering the ice-free portion of the grid cell
                                      divided by the area of the ocean portion of the grid cell.
