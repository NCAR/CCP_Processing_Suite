@If you have submitted, or plan to submit, any historicalMisc runs, could you please send (toGavin.A.Schmidt@@nasa.gov):
a) the model name, 
b) the "rip" identifier(s), 
c) a list of included forcings (and whether they are driven by concentration or emission where relevant), 
d) the name given in the Metafor questionnaire for these simulations, and 
e) an expected due date for the data to be available.

For the included forcings, please use, when possible, the abbreviations found in

http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/docs/cmip5_data_reference_Appendix1-2.pdf.
(These are the abbreviations that should also have been used in the "forcing" global attribute in your netCDF output files.)

Please record the above information in semicolon-separated lists, as in this example:
