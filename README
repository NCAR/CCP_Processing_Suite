Guidelines on how to use the CCP Processing Suite of scripts and tools

General notes:
===============================================================================
1. The purpose of this software is to transpose CESM "history file" output (all
   fields for a given time) to files containing all times for each field. There
   are limits to how many time samples can be contained in a single file, due
   to various restrictions on file sizes, and the software attempts to keep 
   file sizes within that limit. However, there are various permutations of
   CESM outputs that can make determining appropriate file sizes difficult from
   an algorithmic perspective, but the scripts are written in such a way that
   they can be easily modified to account for those permutations.

2. At this time (November 2011) the code to process the single-field format 
   data into CMIP5-compliant format is not completely functional. Please do not
   use that code (under the CMOR2 directory) at this time.

Dependencies:
===============================================================================
The transposition software depends only on the NCO (netCDF Operators) software
package, so it needs to be available somewhere on your system. The location of
the NCO tools can be set in the software. 
The CMIP5 processing software has a fair number of dependencies at this time, 
which are not fully general.

Functionality:
===============================================================================
The general functionality is as follows:

1. Read in each netCDF file (or tarfile of netCDF files) from archival storage;
2. Split each netCDF file into single files for each time-dependent variable,
   placing them into individual subdirectories, which are named for each field
   and suffixed by the dimensionality of the field (i.e., T_4d.d, TS_3d.d, &c.)
   with one file per month of model time;
3. Step through each per-field subdirectory and concatenate along time, first
   creating years of data (12 months) then concatenating years into longer time
   spans;
4. Write each per-field file back to the archival storage system using the CESM
   standard for the directory structure.

The key scripts and their purpose are as follows:

Process_Setup   : The script the user calls, to create the processing script.

process_template: Used by Process_Setup, with changes given by the arguments to
                  Process_Setup, to create the processing script.

experiments.txt : An ASCII-formatted listing of the relevant metadata for each
                  experiment; details on the format are given in the file

mss_* scripts
store_to_archive: Interfaces to the archival system

var_split       : Splits the history netCDF file into its component fields

concatenate_data
var_mon_to_year 
var_year_to_*   : Concatenates the single-field format files along time

time_split      : Splits daily and subdaily history files into individual files
                  per time interval (needed due to the month-spanning nature of
                  most CAM daily and subdaily history files)

days_to_month   : Concatenates files created by time_split into a single file
                  per month, so regular processing can resume

procstat.sh     : Script that notifies user of start/finish, problems, etc. It
                  is tied closely to our postprocessing database, so you may
                  not want to use it.

Key shell script variables in process_template:
===============================================================================
BASEDIR : Must be set to ${HOME}/CCP_Processing_Suite; location of all scripts
          and files
NCKS    : Location of ncks binary
NCRCAT  : Location of ncrcat binary
PROCBASE: Location of local disk cache in which processing with be done\
LOCALDSK: Location of prestaged history data (if applicable)

ARCHIVE_BASE: Location of archival storage base directory into which output
              files will be saved 

These can be modified; look at the process_template script to see which other
shell variables are dependent on them.

Usage:
===============================================================================
1. Modify experiments.txt as needed to reflect the specifics for your case. The
   key fields are:
   a. CCSM case name;
   b. Location (creates dependencies for NCO binaries, local disk cache, &c.);
   c. years of experiment (i.e., the start and end years of the simulation);
   d. DOUT_L_MSROOT (history file location on archive)

2. Run Process_Setup:

prompt> Process_Setup some_cesm_casename cam2.h0 mon

The arguments are as follows:

$1: The CESM case name to be processed
$2: The component name (i.e., cam2.h0, pop.h, clm2.h1, etc.)
$3: The time type of the data (i.e., mon, day, hr6, hr3, etc.)

All are required.

The output is a shell script called "case_name_component_process.sh" that you
can either start with a "Y" response to the "Run script now?" prompt or else
not run and manually edit as needed with any other response.

Depending on the volume of data, the speed of archival retrieval and storage,
system load, etc. the processing can take anywhere from a day or so to a couple
of weeks.
